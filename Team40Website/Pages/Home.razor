            Our team is partnering with Strength Technologies LLC to expand their innovative "Force Rack" technology
            beyond the weight
            room and into a fun, interactive setting. The current Force Rack uses a barbell with load cells to convert a
            user's
            isometric force into digital data for strength training exercises. Our mission is to transform this hardware
            into an
            engaging, arcade-style game that challenges users with entertaining physical contests.

            This project will require a blend of application design, embedded systems programming, and PCB design to
            develop a hardware proof of concept
            with supporting firmware. A key part of our work will be creating compelling ways to visualize user data and
            interact
            with the device. Using resources provided by the client, including the existing code base and hardware, we
            will
            deliver a fully working prototype by the end of the two semesters that successfully converts the True Force
            Rack
            into a complete arcade experience.
